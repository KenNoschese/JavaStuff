Hi there. This will serve as a mk.2 of v0.1 of the Project

Date Format: MM/DD/YYYY-HH:MM:(12)

In this version of the program, instead of using a creating just 1 login screen and guessing if its the admin or a teaching staff that logs in,
this version of the program will make it so that the in the "Displays.displayStartMenu" has an extra option for the Admin and Teaching Staff.

This is to make it so that there is less confusion on the programmers POV on who logs in and what functionalities they have access they can do.
